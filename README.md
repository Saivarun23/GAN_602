Enhancing Detector Performance through Synthetic Data Generation Using Generative Adversarial Networks

Particle detectors are essential in high-energy physics and medical imaging, and material sciences, just like
their testing and calibration, which is very resource-intensive. The project presented herein, Enriching Detector
Performance by Synthetic Data Generation Using GANs, to overcome these challenges using synthesis data generated
via the 2D Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks. Using voxelized particle shower datasets coming from the
CERN Open Data Portal, the project transforms energy deposition data into 2D projections for effective synthetic data
generation. In this project, the GAN model is trained in order to replicate some key characteristics of the particles'
interactions, while statistical metrics on realism will be assessed by comparing synthetic and real data.
